# Infectious-Disease-Spread-Simulation-NetLogo
 A NetLogo-based agent-based simulation modeling the spread of infectious diseases. This project examines social distancing, self-isolation, and movement restrictions to analyze their impact on virus transmission and mortality rates within a simulated population.

#  Infectious Disease Spread Simulation in NetLogo  

##  Overview  
This project is an **agent-based simulation** developed in **NetLogo** to study the spread of an infectious disease within a simulated population. The simulation helps analyze how **movement restrictions, social distancing, and self-isolation** impact the spread of a virus.  

##  Research Objectives  
**Assess the impact of local movement vs. free movement**  
 **Analyze the effect of social distancing vs. no social distancing**  
 **Study the role of self-isolation in containing the disease**  
 **Measure mortality rates and immunity levels over time**  

##  Technologies Used  
 **Simulation Engine:** NetLogo  
 **Programming Language:** NetLogo Scripting  
 **Modeling Approach:** Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)
